# Challenge 2 - Professional Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a professional portfolio that can be submitted to companies that I apply to in the future. Hiring managers can look at a comprehensive overview of the projects I have completed and the skills they required. Portfolios are important because they can give more insight into a candidate's abilities than a brief resume can. I learned how to use CSS variables to code more efficiently, use display:flex to adapt to different screen sizes effectively, and keep a webpage readable with media queries.
